# mqtt-tui

This is a playground for Textalize/aiomqtt examples especial for IOT stuff, but can be used for all MQTT things.    

## mqtt-console-tui.py

MQTT console tui for subscribing and publishing (main project here right now).  
Made with [textualize](https://textual.textualize.io/) :heart: and [aiomqtt](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/aiomqtt) :sparkles: .

## basic-mqtt-console-tui.py

A very basic example to show how subscribe and publish could work.  
Without all the clutter.  


## buttonizer.py

I try to make a graphical frontend for tasmota devices. (not working yet)
